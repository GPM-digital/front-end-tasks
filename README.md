## Welcome

This repository contains small assignments to be carried out in the course of our hiring process. It's a basic **next.js** installation with some of the tools we normally use.

Each "task" has its own readme file that lists the requirements that must be met and on which your work will be evaluated.

Most tasks can be completed in several different ways so feel free to choose your preferred solution method. Unless stated otherwise, each "component" should be seen as part or a larger web app that will therefore share assets and resources.

These assigments will help us learn:

- How you work
- How you solve problems
- How you communicate

## How to apply

1. Clone or fork this repository
2. Install the dependencies (`yarn` or `npm install`) and run the project (`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`) and open the browser at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Complete the task(s) that you've been asked to complete.
4. Send us a pull request or a link to your fork
